# Setup Instructions for Running the Application

To run the application, you need to update the paths in the code to reflect the correct locations for the isles patient data. Please follow the instructions below:

## Step 1: Update user Data  `config.py`

Change the user and pass code to your login details for the Uis Server.

SFTP_USERNAME = 'u123456' - replace with actual username 

SFTP_PASSWORD = 'examplepassword' - Replace with your actual password

## Step 2: Update Patient Data Path in `patientsdatabase.py`

Next, locate the following line in the code:

BASE_FOLDER_PATH = '/Users/g/Desktop/isles24_train_b'  # Update this path accordingly

Instructions:
- Change the value of `BASE_FOLDER_PATH` to the actual path where your patient data is stored.

Example:
BASE_FOLDER_PATH = 'D:\\PatientData\\isles24_train_b'
